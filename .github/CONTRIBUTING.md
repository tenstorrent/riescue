# Riescue Contributing Guide
We aren't ready for contributions just yet, please check back later `:)`

This is a guide for how to contribute to Riescue by either filing an issue or adding a feature.

## Contributing Roadmap
There's a bit of work to do before this is ready for folks to help, but in general
- Issue Form
- Minimum Bug Reproduction Guide (Verilator requires users to generate a unit test to avoid backslide, something to consider here)
- Feature Requests
- PR Guide

- Getting Started Developing Guide
- Debug Guide
- Contribution Standards (CI, Unit Tests, Lint, etc)
