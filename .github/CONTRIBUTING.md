# Development - Getting Started
To contribute to the Riescue repository, it's recommended to work interactively in the container. Please be sure to read the [Contributing Standards](#contribution-standards) to understand how changes can be linted and qualified before committing.

## Install Singularity
Installation for Singularity can be found [here](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html).
Docker containers are not currently supported but can be in the future.

# Installing Editable package
Riescue can be installed locally by cloning and `cd`ing the repo, launching the container, then running:
```
pip install -e .
```
to make Riescue available.


## Command line scripts
After entering the container, the command line scripts can be ran inside the repo.

If Riescue has been installed using `pip`, the command line utility `riescued` can also be ran outside the `riescue/` directory.
