# RiESCUE
RISC-V Directed Test Framework and Compliance Suite, RiESCUE

RiESCUE provides a suite of python scripts and libraries for generating RISC-V tests:
* `RiescueD` - RiESCUE Directed Tests Framework
* `RiescueC` - RiESCUE Compliance Suite `RiescueC`

# Open Source Roadmap
This repository is in the process of open sourcing. There's a bit of housekeeping and restructuring that's needed before Riescue is ready for users. The work can be sumarized below:

## Purpose
This repo aims to provide tools for generating RISC-V test cases.

## RiescueD
`RiescueD` is a python library that creates test cases. The Directed Test Framework offers a range of tools for randomizing data, reserving memory, generating page tables, and randomizing the test environment. It provides a psuedo OS to wrap test scheduling, exception handeling, and pass / fail conditions in the code.

The main test generation flow compiles an ELF binary test using a user-written directed assembly test scenarios as `.s` file. These files contian Riescue Directives to select different memory and environment randomization tools. After generating the completed `.S` assembly file, include files, and linker script the test is compiled and the ELF is generated.

### Features
- OS Code
- Page Tables
- Randomized Privilege Mode
- Randomized Paging Mode

## Future work
There's still a good amount of work to do before the tool is completely open sourced, but the main milestones are to
- Provide API Documentation for RiescueD
- Open Source the Compliance Suite tools - RiescueC
- Open source the Compliance Test Generation tools - CTK
- Installable python library
