**RiESCUE** (pronounced *"rescue"*) is a python library for generating RISC-V tests. It consists of a couple tools:

- `RiescueD` - RiESCUE Directed Test Framework
- `RiescueC` - RiESCUE Compliance Test Generator

This page contains the public documentation for RiESCUE. APIs here are stable and will have a deprecation period before anything's removed.

More documentation will be released as code gets released.
