**RiESCUE** (pronounced *"rescue"*) is an open-source Python library for generating RISC-V tests.

RISC-V processor verification requires comprehensive testing of architectural features with complex scenarios involving virtual memory, privilege modes, and a variety of extensions.
**RiESCUE** provides the tools needed for quick bringup using directed testing and arhcitectural compliance verification.


RiESCUE consists of two main tools:

- :doc:`RiescueD <reference/python_api/RiescueD>` **- Directed Test Framework**
- :doc:`RiescueC <reference/python_api/RiescueC>` **- Compliance Test Generator**
