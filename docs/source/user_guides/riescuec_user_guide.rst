RiescueC User Guide
===================

A comprehensive user guide for ``RiescueC`` is still in development. Check out the  :doc:`RiescueC Tutorials </tutorials/riescuec/riescue_c_brief>` for information on getting started.

If you have any questions or if anything is unclear, please start a discussion on the `RiESCUE GitHub Discussions <https://github.com/tenstorrent/riescue/discussions>` so we can improve the docs.
